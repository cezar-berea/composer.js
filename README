Composer.js is an MVC framework for MooTools >= 1.3. While there are some very
good MVC frameworks out there (backbone.js and Spine, which composer.js pulls a
lot of functionality from), the options for MooTools are lacking. We needed
something as good as the jQuery MVC frameworks but for MooTools.

The framework is now in beta, and is being used to power two projects we're
actively working on. The more we use it, the more bugs we fix and the more we 
find what belongs and what doesn't. In other words, it works great, but it's
still growing and changing slowly.

Note: composer.js houses the main/stable framework. There are two other files:
  
  composer.relational.js
  composer.filtercollection.js

which are currently undocumented and considered experimental/alpha. They are
operational, but subject frequent/substantial changes. *Use at your own risk*!
